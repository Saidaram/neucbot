1) <a name="about>About NeuCBOT</a>
----------------------------------------------------------
### i. <a name="general">General</a>

NeuCBOT is a tool for calculating (alpha,n) yields and 
neutron energy spectra for arbitrary materials under alpha
exposure for arbitrary lists of alpha energies or in the
presence of alpha-emitting contaminants.

The core of the calculations performed with this tool is 
the nuclear reaction database generated by TALYS[0]. By 
default, we proivde data for every naturally occurring
isotope for alpha energies ranging from 0 to 10 MeV in 
0.01 MeV intervals.

If the user wishes to expand their copy of the database to
include alpha energies or isotopes not included in the
default database, the user may install TALYS on their local
machine and run NeuCBOT with the -t option. 

NeuCBOT uses a SRIM-generated[1] stopping power database
to determine the stopping power of the user-specified 
material, and uses this stopping power to integrate over
the alpha energies as they slow down.

If the user wants to perform these calculations for a set
of alpha-emitting contaminants, they can specify the 
isotopes and their concentrations. NeuCBOT looks up decay
data for these isotopes from the ENSDF[2] database and 
saves them in a local database for future use.


### ii. <a name="directory-structure">Directory Structure</a>

Databases are stored in the ./Data directory. Within this 
directory there are the following subdirectories:

 ./Data/StopingPowers/ : SRIM-generated stopping powers for each element
 ./Data/Decays/        : Downloaded ENSDF files with alpha decay data for given isotopes
 ./Data/abundances.dat : Natural abundances of every isotope, from [3]
 ./Data/Isotopes/      : TALYS-generated (alpha,n) reaction data library

Within the ./Data/Isotopes/ directory, there is a 
subdirectory for each element, and a subdirectory within 
this subdirectory for each isotope of that element.

Within an isotope's directory, there is a direcotry called
NSpectra/ which contains outgoing neutrone energy spectra
for alpha particles of a given energy undergoing the 
(alpha,n) reaction on this isotope. 

The TalysOut/ direcotry contains the output from TALYS, from 
each simulated alpha particle at a given energy upon the
isotope. Files in this directory include cross sections for
the various alpha-induced nuclear reactions that may occur,
including the (alpha,n) reaction, as well as cross sections
for producing various excited nuclei and gammas at various
energies. These files may be of particular interest to people
wishing to explore gammas that may be correlated with 
(alpha,n) neutrons.

----------------------------------------------------------
### i. <a name="accessing-the-code">Accessing the code</a>

The code for NeuCBOT is stored in 
<https://github.com/shawest/neucbot>.

To access the code, you can either download it directly by 
clicking the "Clone or download" button and choosing 
"Download ZIP", or checking out the repository with the 
command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shawest/neucbot.git
```

This will create a directory called neucbot in your current
directory.

### ii. <a name="accessing-alphan-reaction-databases">Accessing (alpha,n) reaction databases</a>

There are two options for obtaining (alpha,n) reaction 
databases.

Databases for all naturally occurring isotopes ranging from
0 to 10 MeV alpha energies have been precompiled. These 
databases have been grouped together by element are are 
storred as gzipped tarballs on github at

<https://github.com/neucbot-datasets>

Databases can be downloaded from this github repository and
unzipped with the command
```bash
tar -xvzf X.tar.gz
```
where X is the chemical symbol of the element. These unzipped
files should be stored in ./Data/Isotopes/ in order to be
read by NeuCBOT.

For convenience, NeuCBOT comes with a bash script in the 
./Scripts directory called download_element.sh. This script
takes the chemical symbol of an element as an argument, and
downloads the database for that element, setting it up 
properly. This script can be run from ./neucbot with the
command
```bash
./Scripts/download_element.sh X
```
where X is the chemical symbol of the element.

Alternatively, you can generate your own database,if you 
have TALYS installed on your computer. To do so, run 
NeuCBOT with the -t option. 

This option allows you to calculate (alpha,n) yields and
spectra for isotopes and alpha energies not included in
this database, though it should be noted that this will 
typically slow down the code.

The TALYS software can be downloaded from the homepage at
<http://www.talys.eu/>

3) <a name="usage">Usage</a>
----------------------------------------------------------
Usage: You must specify an alpha list or decay chain file and a target material file.
You may also specify a step size to for integrating the alphas as they slow down in MeV; the default value is 0.01 MeV
        -l [alpha list file name]
        -c [decay chain file name]
        -m [material composition file name]
        -s [alpha step size in MeV]
        -t (to run TALYS for reactions not in libraries)
        -o [output file name]
